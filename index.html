        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The design of energy systems that can cope with the intermittency of renewable energy sources as well as the
            lack of flexibility of demand is a crucial societal concern. Recently, several new technologies, such as
            power-to-heat systems and electrical vehicles, have become ubiquitous, making energy system design even more
            complex. The new discipline of Energy Informatics (EI) plays a central role in providing a scientific basis
            for the design of complex energy systems. In addition to exploring technologies for reducing the overall
            energy demand, it addresses (1) providing a higher extent of consumer flexibility so that more sustainable
            and locally generated energy is used, (2) increasing the resilience of energy generation and (3) improving
            the efficiency of new energy systems. It also provides methodologies and technologies to extract and manage
            information from energy systems. Furthermore, it offers communication and information-processing principles
            to operate energy systems securely.</p>

        <h3>Timetable</h3>
        <p>The summer school will feature a mixture of theoretical and practical sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and
            Thursday.
            Monday will open with a keynote and theoretical sessions, while Friday will start with practical sessions
            and conclude the event with an end note.
            Several poster sessions will give participants opportunities to talk about their own research and exchange
            ideas and feedback with other researchers in their field.
            This exchange can of course be continued in a social event (conference dinner) on Wednesday.</p>

        <p>We will provide a more precise timetable for the event soon.</p>

        <h4>German Informatics Society (GI)</h4>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.gi.de/">German Informatics Society (GI)</a> is the largest German-speaking non-profit
            association for computer science.
            It is comprised of computer scientists from both academia as well as industry and is involved in the formal
            education in schools and universities.
            The GI provides possibilities for knowledge exchange and collaboration amongst peers and furthers computer
            science education.
            The members are structured in regional groups <em>(&ldquo;Regionalgruppen&rdquo;)</em> and topically into
            technical groups with focuses ranging from Computer Science Foundations to Databases and Information
            Systems, Communication Systems, and Software Engineering.

        <h4>Research Training Group "Energy Status Data &ndash; Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and
            Exploitation"</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://energystatusdata.kit.edu/">research-training group</a> is funded by the <a
                href="http://www.dfg.de/en/">German National Science Foundation (DFG)</a> with funds from the Federal
            Government and the German states. It has started on May 1st 2016 and has a duration of 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>An essential aspect is the consumption of energy, particularly of complex systems such as factories or IT
            infrastructures. Important points are the flexibilization of energy consumption, so that the share of
            locally generated 'green' energy increases, robustness of energy provisioning, or the efficient design of
            new energy systems serving these purposes. To accomplish this, a core prerequisite is a structured
            collection, storage and analysis of energy status data. Energy status data describes the provisioning of
            energy, its storage, transmission and consumption, be it the outcomes of measurements, be it metadata such
            as the extent of fatigue of batteries, be it other relevant data such as electricity rates.</p>
        <p>This Research Training Group targets at the handling of energy-status data. To this end, an interdisciplinary
            approach (computer science, engineering, economics, law) is indispensable. It reveals new scientific
            challenges our Ph.D. students are confronted with as part of their education. For instance, we have observed
            that different planning and control purposes require data of different temporal resolution and at different
            aggregation levels. This varying granularity leads to the question how to find outliers in such data at the
            right level of abstraction. Other graduates benefit from new approaches that detect such outliers. They can
            now work more efficiently, e.g., can identify shortcomings of existing models of energy systems
            systematically. An example of such a model would be one describing the behavior of Li-Ion batteries. The
            infrastructure for energy research of the KIT Helmholtz sector such as the EnergyLab 2.0 will be
            subject/object of the Research Training Group to a significant extent; the persons responsible for these
            facilities are part of the principal investigators of this Research Training Group.</p>
