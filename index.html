        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The design of energy systems that can cope with the intermittency of renewable energy sources as well as the lack of flexibility of demand is a crucial societal concern. Recently, several new technologies, such as power-to-heat systems and electrical vehicles, are emerging, making energy system design even more complex. The new discipline of Energy Informatics (EI) plays a central role in providing a scientific basis for the design of complex energy systems. In addition to exploring technologies for reducing the overall energy demand, it addresses (1) providing a higher extent of consumer flexibility so that more sustainable and locally generated energy is used, (2) increasing the resilience of energy generation and (3) improving the efficiency of new energy systems. It also provides methodologies and technologies to extract and manage information from energy systems. Furthermore, it offers communication and information-processing principles to operate energy systems securely.</p>

                <p>His research interests focus on the large-scale integration of decentralized, renewable energy sources into the electricity supply system in combination with the politically motivated reorganization of corporate structures and business processes. The Energy Informatics group in Oldenburg develops ICT-technologies for a future reliable, robust, profitable electricity supply system based on renewable energies &ndash; the Smart Grid. Key issues are:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Open communication standards and data models to ensure the interoperability of IT-architectures.</li>

        <h3>GI</h3>
        <p>German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI)) is a non-profit organization with about 20,000 members living across the world.</p>

        <p>Most of them develop the discipline of informatics by teaching, researching or working in the field of informatics, while others are involved in related business and political areas. The main purposes of this network of professionals are motivate for informatics, develop the scientific discipline and promote the impact informatics has economy, business and society, and to offer career support by the means of networking.</p>

        <p>Members of GI are either individuals, companies or non-governmental organizations. We are proud to be able to claim that our members’ knowledge covers almost everything anyone could wish to know about informatics. Our challenge is to make the best of this broad knowledge base for GI, its members and society as a whole. In times of ever-growing importance and influence of an integrated Europe, GI is increasingly involved in European projects and organizations.</p>

        <h3>Research Training Group "Energie Status Data &ndash; Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and Exploitation"</h3>
        <p>This research-training group is funded by the German National Science Foundation (DFG) with funds from the Federal Government and the German states. It has started on May 1st 2016 and has a duration of 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>A Research Training Group is a research program that gives doctoral students the opportunity to do scientific work and at the same time provides a certain institutional framework, typically by means of some predefined activities. It is essential for a graduate school to have a greater topic, energy-status data in our case, and that the topics of the individual students fit in. On the other hand, students from different disciplines or at least with different backgrounds are explicitly welcome, in order to give way to good synergy effects. PhD students participating in a graduate school are expected to interact with each other intensively, be it that they meet regularly, be it that they have common activities and/or projects.</p>
        <p>This Research Training Group targets at the handling of such data. To this end, an interdisciplinary approach (computer science, engineering, economics, law) is indispensable. It reveals new scientific challenges we will confront Ph.D. students with as part of their education. For instance, we have observed that different planning and control purposes require data of different temporal resolution and at different aggregation levels. This varying granularity leads to the question how to find outliers in such data at the right level of abstraction. Other graduates benefit from new approaches that detect such outliers. They can now work more efficiently, e.g., can identify shortcomings of existing models of energy systems systematically. An example of such a model would be one describing the behavior of Li-Ion batteries. The infrastructure for energy research of the KIT Helmholtz sector such as the EnergyLab 2.0 will be subject/object of our Research Training Group to a significant extent; the persons responsible for these facilities are part of the group of applicants of this Research Training Group.</p>
