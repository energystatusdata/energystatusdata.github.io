        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The design of energy systems that can cope with the intermittency of renewable energy sources as well as the
            lack of flexibility of demand is a crucial societal concern. Recently, several new technologies, such as
            power-to-heat systems and electrical vehicles, have become ubiquitous, making energy system design even more
            complex. The new discipline of Energy Informatics (EI) plays a central role in providing a scientific basis
            for the design of complex energy systems. In addition to exploring technologies for reducing the overall
            energy demand, it addresses (1) providing a higher extent of consumer flexibility so that more sustainable
            and locally generated energy is used, (2) increasing the resilience of energy generation and (3) improving
            the efficiency of new energy systems. It also provides methodologies and technologies to extract and manage
            information from energy systems. Furthermore, it offers communication and information-processing principles
            to operate energy systems securely.</p>

                <p><strong>Tom Brown</strong> completed his BA and MMath in mathematics at the University
                    of Cambridge in 2004 and 2005 respectively. After a PhD in physics at
                    Queen Mary, University of London in 2009, he continued his physics
                    research as a Postdoctoral Researcher at DESY, Germany. In 2012 he
                    switched fields to work on power systems at consultancy firm
                    Energynautics GmbH, and since 2015 he has been working as a
                    Postdoctoral Researcher on the grid integration of renewable energy at
                    the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. His research focuses on
                    system planning for high shares of renewables, including the
                    requirements for the expansion of the transmission grid, flexibility
                    options and coupling to other energy sectors such as transport and
                    heating. He is an advocate of open data and software in the energy

                    <p><strong>Stephen Haben</strong> is a post-doctoral research associate in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. He is also a member of the Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (OCIAM). Since 2014 he has been an active member of the Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) CDT.

                    After completing his undergraduate mathematics degree at the University of Warwick in 2006 he completed a master in modern applications of mathematics at the University of Bath in 2007. In 2011 he achieved his PhD in the conditioning and preconditioning of variational data assimilation problem at the University of Reading before moving to the University of Oxford later in 2013.

                    His most recent work was as the academic project manager and lead researcher on the £30M low carbon network fund project the “Thames Valley Vision”.  On the project, Dr Haben investigated forecasting and mathematical analytical methods for low voltage network demand data for use in a number of applications including scenario forecasting, battery storage control and modelling with limited data.

                    Since 2012 he has been the co-organiser of 4 low voltage demand workshops which focus on forecasting, control and analytical methods applied to low voltage network demand data. In 2014 he was on a prize winning team for the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. His interests include forecasting, clustering methods, optimization, data assimilation, kernel density estimation, quantile regression and error measures.

            It is comprised of computer scientists from both academia as well as industry and is involved in the
            formal
            education in schools and universities.
            The GI provides possibilities for knowledge exchange and collaboration amongst peers and furthers

            science education.
            The members are structured in regional groups <em>(&ldquo;Regionalgruppen&rdquo;)</em> and topically
            into
            technical groups with focuses ranging from Computer Science Foundations to Databases and Information

        <h4>Research Training Group "Energy Status Data &ndash; Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and
            Exploitation"</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://energystatusdata.kit.edu/">research-training group</a> is funded by the <a
                href="http://www.dfg.de/en/">German National Science Foundation (DFG)</a> with funds from the
            Federal
            Government and the German states. It has started on May 1st 2016 and has a duration of 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>An essential aspect is the consumption of energy, particularly of complex systems such as factories or IT
            infrastructures. Important points are the flexibilization of energy consumption, so that the share of
            locally generated 'green' energy increases, robustness of energy provisioning, or the efficient design
            of
            new energy systems serving these purposes. To accomplish this, a core prerequisite is a structured
            collection, storage and analysis of energy status data. Energy status data describes the provisioning of
            energy, its storage, transmission and consumption, be it the outcomes of measurements, be it metadata
            such
            as the extent of fatigue of batteries, be it other relevant data such as electricity rates.</p>
        <p>This Research Training Group targets at the handling of energy-status data. To this end, an
            interdisciplinary
            approach (computer science, engineering, economics, law) is indispensable. It reveals new scientific
            challenges our Ph.D. students are confronted with as part of their education. For instance, we have
            observed
            that different planning and control purposes require data of different temporal resolution and at
            different
            aggregation levels. This varying granularity leads to the question how to find outliers in such data at
            the
            right level of abstraction. Other graduates benefit from new approaches that detect such outliers. They
            can
            now work more efficiently, e.g., can identify shortcomings of existing models of energy systems
            systematically. An example of such a model would be one describing the behavior of Li-Ion batteries. The
            infrastructure for energy research of the KIT Helmholtz sector such as the EnergyLab 2.0 will be
            subject/object of the Research Training Group to a significant extent; the persons responsible for these
            facilities are part of the principal investigators of this Research Training Group.</p>
