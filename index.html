        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The design of energy systems that can cope with the intermittency of renewable energy sources as well as the
            lack of flexibility of demand is a crucial societal concern. Recently, several new technologies, such as
            power-to-heat systems and electrical vehicles, have become ubiquitous, making energy system design even more
            complex. The new discipline of Energy Informatics (EI) plays a central role in providing a scientific basis
            for the design of complex energy systems. In addition to exploring technologies for reducing the overall
            energy demand, it addresses (1) providing a higher extent of consumer flexibility so that more sustainable
            and locally generated energy is used, (2) increasing the resilience of energy generation and (3) improving
            the efficiency of new energy systems. It also provides methodologies and technologies to extract and manage
            information from energy systems. Furthermore, it offers communication and information-processing principles
            to operate energy systems securely.</p>

        <p>The Summer School entitled <em>&ldquo;Communication Technology and Data Analytics for Future Energy
            Systems&rdquo;</em> focuses on providing a strong foundation in the principles of Energy Informatics, with a
            focus on communication technology, data management, and analytics. The summer school will be a venue for
            graduate students, researchers and practitioners to learn about and contribute to this field.</p>
        <p>The summer school is a joint event of the section „Energy Informatics“ within the <a
                href="https://www.gi.de/">German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik)</a> and the <a
                href="http://energystatusdata.kit.edu/">DFG Research Training Group &ldquo;Energy Status Data –
            Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and Exploitation&rdquo; at Karlsruhe Institute of
            Technology (KIT)</a>. Leading researchers in the field of Energy Informatics will give an end-to-end
            perspective on both the fundamentals as well as advanced topics of communication technology, data management
            and analytics.</p>
        <p>The summer school is co-organized by the <a href="http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/computer-networks/">Chair
            of Computer Networks and Computer Communications</a> led by <a
                href="http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/computer-networks/staff-and-guests/professor-hermann-de-meer/">Professor
            Hermann de Meer</a>, where the main contact person is <a
                href="http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/computer-networks/staff-and-guests/robert-basmadjian/">Dr. Robert
            Basmadjian</a>. The chair's research focuses (amongst others) on the topics of energy efficient systems and
            communication systems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stephen Haben</strong> is a post-doctoral research associate in the Mathematical
                        Institute at the University of Oxford. He is also a member of the Oxford Centre for Industrial
                        and Applied Mathematics (OCIAM). Since 2014 he has been an active member of the Industrially
                        Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) CDT.

                        After completing his undergraduate mathematics degree at the University of Warwick in 2006 he
                        completed a master in modern applications of mathematics at the University of Bath in 2007. In
                        2011 he achieved his PhD in the conditioning and preconditioning of variational data
                        assimilation problem at the University of Reading before moving to the University of Oxford
                        later in 2013.

                        His most recent work was as the academic project manager and lead researcher on the £30M low
                        carbon network fund project the “Thames Valley Vision”. On the project, Dr Haben investigated
                        forecasting and mathematical analytical methods for low voltage network demand data for use in a
                        number of applications including scenario forecasting, battery storage control and modelling
                        with limited data.

                        Since 2012 he has been the co-organiser of 4 low voltage demand workshops which focus on
                        forecasting, control and analytical methods applied to low voltage network demand data. In 2014
                        he was on a prize winning team for the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. His interests
                        include forecasting, clustering methods, optimization, data assimilation, kernel density
                        estimation, quantile regression and error measures.

            non-profit
            association for computer science.
            It is comprised of computer scientists from both academia as well as industry and is involved in the
            formal
            education in schools and universities.
            The GI provides possibilities for knowledge exchange and collaboration amongst peers and furthers
            computer
            science education.
            The members are structured in regional groups <em>(&ldquo;Regionalgruppen&rdquo;)</em> and topically
            into
            technical groups with focuses ranging from Computer Science Foundations to Databases and Information
            Systems, Communication Systems, and Software Engineering.

        <h4>Research Training Group "Energy Status Data &ndash; Informatics Methods for its Collection, Analysis and
            Exploitation"</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://energystatusdata.kit.edu/">research-training group</a> is funded by the <a
                href="http://www.dfg.de/en/">German National Science Foundation (DFG)</a> with funds from the
            Federal
            Government and the German states. It has started on May 1st 2016 and has a duration of 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>An essential aspect is the consumption of energy, particularly of complex systems such as factories or IT
            infrastructures. Important points are the flexibilization of energy consumption, so that the share of
            locally generated 'green' energy increases, robustness of energy provisioning, or the efficient design
            of
            new energy systems serving these purposes. To accomplish this, a core prerequisite is a structured
            collection, storage and analysis of energy status data. Energy status data describes the provisioning of
            energy, its storage, transmission and consumption, be it the outcomes of measurements, be it metadata
            such
            as the extent of fatigue of batteries, be it other relevant data such as electricity rates.</p>
        <p>This Research Training Group targets at the handling of energy-status data. To this end, an
            interdisciplinary
            approach (computer science, engineering, economics, law) is indispensable. It reveals new scientific
            challenges our Ph.D. students are confronted with as part of their education. For instance, we have
            observed
            that different planning and control purposes require data of different temporal resolution and at
            different
            aggregation levels. This varying granularity leads to the question how to find outliers in such data at
            the
            right level of abstraction. Other graduates benefit from new approaches that detect such outliers. They
            can
            now work more efficiently, e.g., can identify shortcomings of existing models of energy systems
            systematically. An example of such a model would be one describing the behavior of Li-Ion batteries. The
            infrastructure for energy research of the KIT Helmholtz sector such as the EnergyLab 2.0 will be
            subject/object of the Research Training Group to a significant extent; the persons responsible for these
            facilities are part of the principal investigators of this Research Training Group.</p>
